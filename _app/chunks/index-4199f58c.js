And, um, and you want exposure to RUNE, but you don\u2019t wanna, you know, you just wanna use Keplr and all that then same would go from that side. You could just ACE him from, from your Keplr wallet from ATOM, and then you\u2019re exposed to 50, 50 ATOM and RUNE the entire time you\u2019re in the pool. But then when you go to withdraw, it\u2019s basically, it\u2019s basically swapped back to, uh, to ATOM on the way out. So your exposure\u2019s always 50 50, but all you have to touch is ATOM and Keplr that you\u2019re already using. So you always have a lot of just some convenient steps, really?

So you can even just like add in, you can just add in like your, your Bitcoin, ETH , BNB chain addresses all that to the portfolio tracker too, and you\u2019ll be able to just track balances.

Perhaps like if you have some normy friends or something that have some liquidity and don\u2019t know, uh, what they\u2019re doing, um, and so on, but that got me pretty hyped.

So that\u2019s not super accessible to most people, I would say it\u2019s inaccessible to most people. So we\u2019ve just decided to tackle that from a Thor swap side of things and give, you know, a fairly generic interface that you could use for anything multisig, but then make some actions within that interface super easy as well. So, you know, if you wanna bond your node, if you want to, uh, provide liquidity withdrawal, liquidity, you know, we\u2019ll make those things, just the click of a button, but then if you need to do something more complex as well, you can enter your own memo, you can build your own transactions from scratch.

So I think we, we I\u2019m okay with the idea of getting rid of the erc20 with the exception of the stables, because the stables are used. Um, the stable sys are used by arbitrage bots to arbitrage, and we don\u2019t wanna take that from them in a sense. And we also use those as ways for the network to know the price of RUNE in dollars. And so that it uses that information to, for, from mostly for telemetry, but like it also use it for, um, you know, setting up a minimum, uh, Upbound fee and like, theoretically, we could use that same thing to like say that the gas price for transacting on THORChain instead of being 0.02 RUNE, which is a fluctuating price, obviously we could just set to be like 10 cents for some amount. Right. And then no matter what RUNE price is, the, the gas fee is, you know, static, which is kind of more predictable, which is also better for the community. So, uh, I\u2019m okay with the idea of getting rid the ERC twenties, especially cause I don\u2019t really contribute that much value anyway.

So that\u2019s not super accessible to most people, I would say it\u2019s inaccessible to most people. So we\u2019ve just decided to tackle that from a Thor swap side of things and give, you know, a fairly generic interface that you could use for anything multisig, but then make some actions within that interface super easy as well. So, you know, if you wanna bond your node, if you want to, uh, provide liquidity withdrawal, liquidity, you know, we\u2019ll make those things, just the click of a button, but then if you need to do something more complex as well, you can enter your own memo, you can build your own transactions from scratch.

Um, the stable sys are used by arbitrage bots to arbitrage, and we don\u2019t wanna take that from them in a sense. And we also use those as ways for the network to know the price of RUNE in dollars. And so that it uses that information to, for, from mostly for telemetry, but like it also use it for, um, you know, setting up a minimum, uh, Upbound fee and like, theoretically, we could use that same thing to like say that the gas price for transacting on THORChain instead of being 0.02 RUNE, which is a fluctuating price, obviously we could just set to be like 10 cents for some amount. Right. And then no matter what RUNE price is, the, the gas fee is, you know, static, which is kind of more predictable, which is also better for the community. So, uh, I\u2019m okay with the idea of getting rid the ERC twenties, especially cause I don\u2019t really contribute that much value anyway.
