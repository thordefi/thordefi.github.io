<h2 id="introduction"><a href="#introduction">Introduction</a></h2>
<p><strong>Speaker 0    00:02:02</strong>    Yo what’s up.  </p>
<p><strong>Speaker 1    00:02:05</strong>    What’s up. What’s happening? How are you  </p>
<p><strong>Speaker 0    00:02:08</strong>    Doing great. I was actually just, I just listened to you and Chad B uh, with donkey, uh, just before this. So you got me all hyped up. <laugh></laugh></p>
<p><strong>Speaker 1    00:02:19</strong>    Well, you get another dose of me. I hope it’s not too many.  </p>
<p><strong>Speaker 0    00:02:23</strong>    No way. Never is. <laugh></laugh></p>
<p><strong>Speaker 1    00:02:26</strong>    I almost don’t recommend what’s going on with you with your new PFP there. Uh,  </p>
<p><strong>Speaker 0    00:02:30</strong>    <laugh></laugh></p>
<p><strong>Speaker 1    00:02:30</strong>    Keep looking for the kind news. Yeah.  </p>
<p><strong>Speaker 0    00:02:34</strong>    <laugh>yeah, it might be back that one’s kind of, the iconic kind of became the iconic chat throughout PFP, but, um, I’m playing around with these other ones. I really dig these, these trip and apes, these like psychedelic apes.  </laugh></p>
<p><strong>Speaker 1    00:02:46</strong>    Yeah.  </p>
<p><strong>Speaker 0    00:02:47</strong>    They’re pretty cool. They’re cool. I dig it. What’s new with you.  </p>
<p><strong>Speaker 1    00:02:52</strong>    Oh, you know, just building,  </p>
<p><strong>Speaker 0    00:02:55</strong>    Uh, yeah. These, these devs and actually doing something <laugh></laugh></p>
<p><strong>Speaker 1    00:03:00</strong>    Yeah. It’s, it’s really cool. We have such a great team and it’s, it’s just really cool to start to see stuff we’ve been working on for many months, start to come together as a real product that you can use. You know, it’s, it’s kind of thankless to do all the backend work and the smart contract work and not have anything to see, you know, to show for it. But now that we’re in like the internal testing phase and we can start to show like swaps happening in the UI, using the aggregator and we can start to see like the multisig interface coming together. It’s just really cool to start to see the fruits, your labor, you know?  </p>
<p><strong>Speaker 0    00:03:34</strong>    Absolutely. Yeah. And myself and the whole community. Uh, thanks the big brains. I see some others in the chat that, uh, thank you to everyone actually building, but yeah, it’s really, it it’s so cool. I feel like right now we’re in a phase of a lot of stuff actually rolling out and like getting to the point where people are seeing, seeing demos or, or using it themselves. And a lot of those features we can kind of chat through today, a handful of things on the agenda and then just, uh, open it up to discussion Q and a kind of whatever people wanna, wanna get into. But, um, yeah, I’m going to pin up some tweets here. Um,  </p>
<h2 id="atom"><a href="#atom">ATOM</a></h2>
<p><strong>Speaker 1    00:04:10</strong>    Yeah. Almost forgot to mention ATOM. It,  </p>
<p><strong>Speaker 0    00:04:12</strong>    Yeah. Kinda  </p>
<p><strong>Speaker 1    00:04:13</strong>    Stuck upon us again for the second time around.  </p>
<p><strong>Speaker 0    00:04:16</strong>    Yeah, we get, we get to celebrate it twice. Uh <laugh></laugh></p>
<p><strong>Speaker 1    00:04:21</strong>    But so nice. We integrated twice  </p>
<p><strong>Speaker 0    00:04:24</strong>    <laugh>but yeah, that is great to see finally live. So yeah, as of what, uh, night, like 15 hours ago or something now swaps are back up, you can add liquidity, you can swap. I don’t think there’s a ton of liquidity just yet, but hopefully that’s gonna be rolling in soon, but if you are a holder of both RUNE and ATOM, then kind of a no brainer to, uh, throw that into the liquidity pool and, uh, start earning yield based on those swaps. Um, I’m pinning up a few things right now, but we have, um, we have some merch that just launched that is the cosmos THORChain integration merch, and we’ll be giving away one of those on the space today as well. So somebody that asks a, a question later on, uh, is gonna win. One of those shirts comes in four different colors. And let me see, did I pin the right thing one sec? Oh, shoot. I meant to pin one second here with these.  </laugh></p>
<p><strong>Speaker 1    00:05:25</strong>    I just went and uh, finally picked up my TERA Luna THORChain shirts. Uh, so those are gonna be a fun souvenir.  </p>
<p><strong>Speaker 0    00:05:33</strong>    Oh man. <laugh>wow. Yeah. Nice. I, uh, I never picked one of those up, but yeah, nowadays that that’s a, that’s a collector’s item. <laugh></laugh></laugh></p>
<p><strong>Speaker 1    00:05:43</strong>    Yeah, they got delivered to my mailbox a long time ago and I just never went and got ‘em but now I picked them up. I’m like, I don’t know what I’m gonna do with these things. Maybe wherever painting  </p>
<p><strong>Speaker 0    00:05:51</strong>    <laugh>absolutely. Yeah, no, I do the same thing. I always, uh, it always takes me like two months to go pick things up when, when something’s sent to the box. <laugh>yeah. But okay. Anyways, now I’ve, I’ve got, I’ve got the tweets organized that I was trying to. So the first one that you’re seeing is an overview of just everything about the ATOM launch. So if you are maybe new to THORChain, haven’t used Thorswap before we’ve got a bunch of explainers, um, guides, video guides, everything like that, walking through exactly like step by step, how to do these things. If you’re, if you’re new to cross chain swaps and liquidity pooling, but I’ll just give like a little brief overview just in case anyone’s brand new, but basically this means the RUNE-ATOM pool is live. So that is kind of what allows for these cross chain swaps on the back end using RUNE.  </laugh></laugh></p>
<p><strong>Speaker 0    00:06:43</strong>    So, you know, we’ve got BTC-RUNE pool, ATOM-RUNE pool now, uh, ETH-RUNE pool and so on. And so this means you can swap native ATOM straight to BTC, back and forth ETH DOGE  Litecoin , BNB er20, bep2 assets, uh, Bitcoin cash. If, if that’s your thing <laugh>, uh, and a lot more common, but you can do that as of today. And you can also earn yield by liquidity pooling. So providing your RUNE and ATOM, and then you’re earning based on some of it’s coming from block awards on THORChain, some of it’s coming from, uh, the actual swap fee usage. So there’s guides on both swaps and LP to walk you through exactly how you could do all that you can use. You can use your Keplr wallet for the ATOM side, everything you’re used to, uh, ledger as well directly or through Keplr. And, um, yeah, it’s super exciting to see that, uh, finally live. So  </laugh></p>
<p><strong>Speaker 1    00:07:38</strong>    If you’re, well, we need you, we need some liquidity up in here. So come on over.  </p>
<p><strong>Speaker 0    00:07:42</strong>    Yeah, we really do. I think I saw it was only in like the low six figures, um, like 115 K or something last I checked maybe a little higher now, but yeah, hopefully we see some whales, uh, come through. I would definitely say if you are a whale or even even a bit smaller at this point, you’ll you’ll wanna add symmetrically. Um, because otherwise you’re kind of disrupting the pool balance, uh, quite a bit with when it’s low liquidity, but, um, yeah, we need you and, and you’ll, you’ll be, you’ll be, uh, a substantial chunk of the pool <laugh>in the early days. So definitely, definitely good to get in there.  </laugh></p>
<p><strong>Speaker 1    00:08:18</strong>    Yeah. I kind of made that mistake myself kind of embarrassed to say last night it was super late. I was like, oh, the pool’s live. I’m gonna throw some RUNE in there. And I didn’t check like how small the pool was. So I, I got wrecked pretty bad on the slippage there.  </p>
<p><strong>Speaker 0    00:08:31</strong>    <laugh>Ooh, <laugh>dang. Yeah. I might need to get into that one. I actually, I’m maybe ashamed to say I don’t have any atoms, so maybe I’ll have to maybe I’ll have to pick some up or, or, uh, a, him, some  ASYM RUNE once, once the pools a bit deep and all that, but, um,  </laugh></laugh></p>
<p><strong>Speaker 1    00:08:49</strong>    Yeah, that’s one of my favorite ways to get into something, you know, is like, if you don’t have ATOM, you’re interested in the exposure, just ASYM into it, and now you’ve got exposure to both. You don’t have to worry even about setting up another wallet. Like you could just keep your RUNE wallet and provide liquidity there.  </p>
<p><strong>Speaker 0    00:09:05</strong>    Yeah. And the same would go if you’re, if you’re a Cosmo not, and you’re, you know, you’re an ATOM maxi and you’ve just recently been indoctrinated into, into the THORChain cult. And, um, and you want exposure to RUNE, but you don’t wanna, you know, you just wanna use Keplr and all that then same would go from that side. You could just ACE him from, from your Keplr wallet from ATOM, and then you’re exposed to 50, 50 ATOM and RUNE the entire time you’re in the pool. But then when you go to withdraw, it’s basically, it’s basically swapped back to, uh, to ATOM on the way out. So your exposure’s always 50 50, but all you have to touch is ATOM and Keplr that you’re already using. So you always have a lot of just some convenient steps, really? Like the, the math works out the same. Um, we have, we have, again, this is all kind of goes in more depth in the, in the tutorials and stuff like that if, if people need to dive deeper. But, uh, yeah.  </p>
<h2 id="thoryield-20"><a href="#thoryield-20">THORYield 2.0</a></h2>
<p><strong>Speaker 0    00:10:03</strong>    Cool. And then, yeah, but that’s, uh, we can definitely take some questions, uh, if, if people maybe will wait on request for just a little bit, just to go knock out a couple more things, but we can definitely open it up. If people have questions regarding the, the ATOM integration. Um, that second tweet shows the pretty sweet merch that I was mentioning it’s available for sale, or somebody’s gonna win one, uh, just by hanging out in the space and asking a question. So, uh, maybe we’ll have that be reserved just to somebody a asks a Cosmo specific question. That seems to make sense to me. Um, yeah, so let’s see, uh, another thing coming up, um, tomorrow actually we’ve got the brand new Thor yield mobile app is launching, so that’s pretty exciting for both. Um, why assume it’s let me make sure it’s still on track for tomorrow. Right. Has anything gone down with the app store that you’re aware of? <laugh></laugh></p>
<p><strong>Speaker 1    00:11:06</strong>    No, I think we’re all good. Um, they of course have their questions, but I, I think we’re in the clear  </p>
<p><strong>Speaker 0    00:11:12</strong>    Okay, sweet. I do see a couple regress already, but we’ll, um, get, we’ll bring everyone up in, in just a, just a little bit here, so just, just hang tight. Um, but yeah, that’s, that’s coming tomorrow. We’ll have, again, guides all of that coming out with the launch, but basically it’s a full redesign, um, really nice. You can, of course track all your LP positions. You don’t have to keep entering your wallet addresses every time you can just save it into an account right. On your right on your phone. Um, you know, you’re not managing things directly from THORYield, but it’s just a good way to, you know, be a Degen and check on your LP positions 45 times a day, and, uh, check on your staking check on, um, portfolio tracking as well. So you can even just like add in, you can just add in like your, your Bitcoin, ETH , BNB chain addresses all that to the portfolio tracker too, and you’ll be able to just track balances. So, um, yeah, it’s really gonna be a lot more useful and just like user friendly has a new redesign, nice clean look. So pretty excited that that’s, uh, coming out tomorrow. Uh, yeah, I’ve been, I’ve been poking around on it and it’s definitely, uh, something about this, this new THORYield, like hooked me a lot more. Like I, uh, it just feels, it just feels so much more accessible and, uh, yeah. Now I’m gonna be checking like five times a day. I’m sure. <laugh></laugh></p>
<p><strong>Speaker 1    00:12:33</strong>    Yeah, it’s kind of like the ultimate Chad dashboard for your mobile on the go. So <laugh>, I was already a big user of the, the old version, but the new version is even cooler. So it’s exciting to have that.  </laugh></p>
<p><strong>Speaker 0    00:12:45</strong>    I think you just came up with the new slogan for Thor yield also. <laugh></laugh></p>
<p><strong>Speaker 1    00:12:50</strong>    The ultimate Chad dashboard,  </p>
<p><strong>Speaker 0    00:12:52</strong>    The ultimate Chad dashboard 2.0, THORyield coming July 15th, 2022.  </p>
<p><strong>Speaker 3    00:13:00</strong>    <laugh></laugh></p>
<p><strong>Speaker 0    00:13:04</strong>    Cool. So, yeah, that’s another thing to keep on your radar. Um, what else have we got here coming up? Um, definitely did a lot of a, a lot of deck’s aggregation teasing this week. I, I see Chad B listening. I was telling mogarchy, I was just listening to you guys on donkey right before this. So that got me all hyped up and, and ready to go on this space. Um, but yeah, I mean, I, I, I know probably don’t wanna put an exact date on it, but I know that’s getting real close. We’ve shared a bunch of teasers of the, the UI and, and things like that in the last week or so. Uh, which makes me think it’s getting pretty, pretty close here. So that’s gonna be a big one.  </p>
<p><strong>Speaker 1    00:13:44</strong>    Yeah. I’m always, I’m always nervous about dates myself. We have some internal targets we’re trying to hit, but, uh, if I say them out loud, then we won’t hit them. So we’ll just keep quiet for now  </p>
<h2 id="dex-aggregation"><a href="#dex-aggregation">DEX Aggregation</a></h2>
<p><strong>Speaker 0    00:13:55</strong>    Soon. TM is, uh, yeah. Yeah. <laugh>exactly. Yeah. Yeah. I, I don’t even know what those targets are myself for on your side, but like, uh, yeah, don’t even say it, but, uh, feels, feels really close. So that’s gonna be an exciting one because, uh, I think we all kind of preach into the choir here, but the, uh, Dex aggregation just feels like such a massive thing and it’s only gonna get better and better as, as, as we expand to more and more aggregators and the aggregator of aggregators and, and so on and so forth. So gonna be really exciting. I’m, I’m, I’m pumped to see the first one roll out.  </laugh></p>
<p><strong>Speaker 1    00:14:31</strong>    Yeah, for sure. It’s, uh, you know, been, been a long time covenant. I feel like we’ve talked about it in so many spaces, but it’s about to be real and, you know, once everybody gets to use it, I think they’re gonna love it. I think it’s gonna be a, a huge product for the whole ecosystem. You know, getting this Dex aggregation, going really just expands the power of THORChain and takes it out of kind of, I wouldn’t say a silo, but a limited, uh, field of exposure to liquidity, to user bases and just blows that up massively. So it’s gonna drive liquidity both ways, you know, everything that we’re aggregating like sushi and uni and in the opposite direction, a lot more liquidity coming to THORChain as well,  </p>
<p><strong>Speaker 0    00:15:11</strong>    A hundred percent, and then start getting that integrated into other apps and wallets and, and so on and, uh, yeah, off to the races. So that’s gonna be huge.  </p>
<p><strong>Speaker 1    00:15:22</strong>    It’s been really cool also to see, you know, all of our documentation start to come together for the API. I know we get quite a few developers jumping in these spaces sometimes. So we’re really excited to share that stuff with you soon as well, uh, of how easy and simple it’s gonna be to use our API to, you know, do cross-train swaps without having to do all this legwork and figure out, you know, how the smart contracts work and how THORChain works and how there’s 50 moving parts. Instead, you just say what you wanna sell and what you wanna buy. And we take care of the rest.  </p>
<p><strong>Speaker 0    00:15:54</strong>    Yeah. Do you wanna speak a little deeper on like what the integration process would, would look like? Like how involved it would be? Uh, because for example, I was just seeing familiar cow had some tweets about like that and from nine rounds, I think about like the idea of like an NFT marketplace integrating, um, you know, cross chain swaps to be able to pay for an NFT in BTC and, and, or not even just that, but, you know, through any token. Right. So like how, how simple would it be for like other projects to, to just plug that in, like what’s gonna be involved,  </p>
<p><strong>Speaker 1    00:16:26</strong>    We’re really trying to make it as simple as possible for any developer. So if you’ve got any experience, you know, working with an SDK, uh, we’re gonna give you a software development kit with all of the examples that you need. You know, here’s your sample code, this is what you could do a really simple swap with and, and just break it down to the most bare fundamentals of, of the small pieces that you need and just try to make it as easy as possible. So, you know, the goal is that if somebody has, you know, some idea of, you know, what a blockchain is and how to work with an SDK, then, you know, maybe they can integrate in a couple days. Nice.  </p>
<h2 id="multisig-wallet---thorsafe"><a href="#multisig-wallet---thorsafe">Multisig wallet - THORSafe</a></h2>
<p><strong>Speaker 0    00:17:01</strong>    Sounds pretty sweet. That’s cool. Awesome. Well, yeah, definitely looking forward to everything, aggregator and API, that’s gonna be huge. Um, one other thing we were getting pretty hyped on is the, the multisig interface, um, check out the third pin tweet right now, the, the last one, uh, our lead Degen, um, tokens wizard, uncle badgers, uh, had a really solid thread explaining all the possibilities, um, with this, like, like with the THORChain multisig and making it accessible through, through the store swap interface. Uh, I’m still getting my head around a lot of it, but, uh, it got me really excited, just like, you know, potential to do like Dow run THORChain nodes. Um, so with some, uh, you know, have to kind of trust the, the operator and stuff like that, but, um, could really be like a huge thing to scale scale THORChain security, uh, you know, allow people to, to get in on some, some RUNE yield, um, even like you can scroll through the thread, but there’s, there’s a lot of, uh, interesting ideas like liquidity providing through multisig, um, you know, helping onboarding other users through, through multisig. Perhaps like if you have some normy friends or something that have some liquidity and don’t know, uh, what they’re doing, um, and so on, but that got me pretty hyped. What, what are your thoughts or like, what do you think are gonna be some of the key, uh, use cases there?  </p>
<p><strong>Speaker 1    00:18:31</strong>    You know, I, I think with really any ecosystem and any chain, like once you reach a certain level of maturity, it’s really important to have multisig what it, you could do, really, just so many use cases. Like you mentioned, you know, we talk about node operations, but even just like treasury management or, you know, any project or group of people that needs to hold funds in a secure manner and not have one person be in charge of that, or be able to rug, uh, you know, th chain multisig has been here for a while, but it’s been line only. So that’s not super accessible to most people, I would say it’s inaccessible to most people. So we’ve just decided to tackle that from a Thor swap side of things and give, you know, a fairly generic interface that you could use for anything multisig, but then make some actions within that interface super easy as well. So, you know, if you wanna bond your node, if you want to, uh, provide liquidity withdrawal, liquidity, you know, we’ll make those things, just the click of a button, but then if you need to do something more complex as well, you can enter your own memo, you can build your own transactions from scratch. So we’re kind of building just a really simple UI. That’s got all the power of multisig without having to, you know, figure out how to use a CLI.  </p>
<p><strong>Speaker 0    00:19:50</strong>    Yeah. That’s, I mean, even just for personal security might make sense for, for some, some people to, to set up a multisig to just control whatever they’re doing. Um, and yeah, like I definitely wasn’t about to do some command line stuff and I’m sure I’m sure a lot of I’m sure almost everybody is kind of, uh, on my page with that. So really cool to see it be, become more accessible and, um, you know, like just all the use cases that’ll kind of emerge out of that, like you said, treasury management, like other other projects, um, whatever just allows for a lot more flexibility. So that’ll be a cool one. Um, I don’t know if you, we have any timeline to give on that, but seems pretty close based on the UI and all that.  </p>
<p><strong>Speaker 1    00:20:30</strong>    Yeah. Uh, I guess I’ll stay, it’s probably a similar timeline to the aggregator. How about that?  </p>
<p><strong>Speaker 0    00:20:37</strong>    Sounds fair. Cool. I’m going to, let’s bring up, uh, GS Nat is requesting and anyone else can feel free to request. We’ll kind of transition into everything else unless you thought of any other, any other updates that, uh, forgot about, but yeah. Otherwise can just chat ATOM stuff. Um,  </p>
<p><strong>Speaker 1    00:21:01</strong>    I think we forgot to drop the name on the multisig  </p>
<p><strong>Speaker 0    00:21:04</strong>    <laugh>oh, we did. Yes, we did. Thank you. Uh, yeah. Thorsafe so this interface and everything for managing, um, you know, a THORChain multisig made simple, just made sense to kind of put it in a neater package than just saying THORChain multi chain, uh, multisig interface. So thorsafe is the product name, so somehow that gives it a better feel. I don’t know. <laugh></laugh></laugh></p>
<p><strong>Speaker 1    00:21:30</strong>    Yeah, I like it.  </p>

<p><strong>Speaker 4    00:21:31</strong>    Yeah. Hey, can you hear me?  </p>
<p><strong>Speaker 0    00:21:35</strong>    Yeah, I can. We can hear you.  </p>
<p><strong>Speaker 4    00:21:37</strong>    Uh, so Mike ki is regarding, uh, going behind of uni uni is going, uh, so the, we have best team. We are doing best in this building. We have best team, but why uni is going?  </p>
<p><strong>Speaker 1    00:22:05</strong>    I’m sorry, I couldn’t quite make out what the question was. Did you get a jet?  </p>
<p><strong>Speaker 0    00:22:09</strong>    No, I was gonna say the same. Yeah. Um, would you wanna try again, uh, maybe just a bit clearer if possible. Uh, didn’t quite catch that.  </p>
<p><strong>Speaker 4    00:22:22</strong>    Sure. I wanted to say that why UNIswap team is going ahead of whilst we are doing best building hard in these situation, then why UNI is going ahead of  </p>
<p><strong>Speaker 0    00:22:35</strong>    Why is UNIswap ahead of us?  </p>
<p><strong>Speaker 4    00:22:37</strong>    Yes.  </p>
<p><strong>Speaker 0    00:22:39</strong>    Um, like, like, well, in terms of, I suppose, they’re ahead in terms of, uh, market cap, but definitely not in terms of, uh, cross chain <laugh>functionality, but you know, the market can do what it’s gonna do, but, you know, I mean, UNISWAP is like the, kind of the original decks, right? I mean, obviously it’s siloed to only Ethereum, but it kind of has its uh, like legacy, you know, importance and user base. And like obviously E is still like the biggest, uh, you know, L one ecosystem. So there’s still a lot of activity going on there. So there, there is value there, but you know, I think like obviously we’re huge. Uh THORChain and Thorswap bulls here. So we think it makes sense that this, we think this is a much bigger, uh, issue to tackle right. Much more complex. It’s like something that UNISWAP doesn’t even seem to be, uh, thinking about, at least from my vantage point. I don’t know if they are <laugh>but um, yeah. You know, I mean, this is like UNO on steroids, right? I mean, THORChain is a good way to understand THORChain is to think of it like UNISWAP, but for every chain in theory, and then Thor swap is the way of, uh, aggregating all of the tokens of all of those chains over time, uh, to be like a UN swap times a thousand. Right. So, you know, I think we’ll get there.  </laugh></laugh></p>
<p><strong>Speaker 4    00:24:04</strong>    Yeah, yeah, yeah. I am me.  </p>
<p><strong>Speaker 1    00:24:06</strong>    The thing I’ll add to that is just that, you know, we’re not trying to replace UNISWAP or outcompete UNISWAP, we’re trying to harness the power and the talent of UNISWAP and you know, everything that they can offer and bring that to our users in addition to everything that THORChain can bring. And that’s really just the amazing beauty of decks aggregation is bringing together, you know, all the innovations from the ecosystem, no matter if they’re happening on one inch or UNISWAP or zero X or whatever it might be, we just wanna bring all those features together through Dex aggregation so that the users get the  </p>
<p><strong>Speaker 4    00:24:44</strong>    Yeah, understood. Even we have launched our minute or like blockchain, we have own our blockchain. Uh, now we trust that is the best in the world. Uh, so we just start there to be invested in this chat.  </p>
<p><strong>Speaker 0    00:25:06</strong>    Yeah. I think, uh, yeah, you know, I think this is the best <laugh>I, I think, uh, this huge potential and that’s why we’re all so pumped on it, but, um, yeah. Good clarification. Um, mogarchy, uh, just that, you know, like yeah, like Thor chain’s specialty or th swaps, it’s not to, um, you know, integrate every ERC 20 or every IBC asset in the future or every, uh, you know, whatever other L1, um, gets integrated, but rather to, to connect those main chains, kind of the difficult part that’s that’s the THORChain focus, but then, but then Thorswap other aggregators other, um, like, you know, it taps into that liquidity. Like the, the V1 of the Thorswap aggregator will literally use UNiswap liquidity pools so they can kind of do what they do best, which is, you know, get that, get that ETH ERC 20, um, liquidity. And then THORChain can tap into that, uh, you know, to connect all of those assets with everything that THORChain is connected with. So that’s really, that’s really what we’re excited about,  </laugh></p>
<p><strong>Speaker 4    00:26:06</strong>    Chad. Yeah, we pro oh yeah, we produce and especially, I want to thank, uh, Chad Beford for, uh, doing hard, doing building hard in this situation.  </p>
<p><strong>Speaker 6    00:26:20</strong>    Oh,  </p>
<p><strong>Speaker 0    00:26:20</strong>    You’re welcome. Speaking of him <laugh>how’s it going? Chad?  </laugh></p>

<h2 id="q3---where-do-the-actual-signatures-held"><a href="#q3---where-do-the-actual-signatures-held">Q3 - Where do the actual signatures held?</a></h2>
<p><strong>Speaker 6    00:26:23</strong>    Good, good. I, so I have two questions for you guys. One is a serious question. One’s a fun question. Uh, serious question first. Um, so for thorsafe right, the new multisig that S off working on, I’m really excited about this. This is really awesome. This is something like, I actually had one of our investors reach out to us and like, Hey, how do we do a multisig like, well, you know, use a CLI it’s really hard, blah, blah, blah. And I’m really happy that you guys are building this. My question to you though outta curiosity. Two part question, I suppose, is that, uh, does it work for other chains as well? Like can, can you like secure BTC with this same thing? Um, and then two is where do the actual signatures held? They held on like Thorswap servers or you like put it up on some sort of like IPFS system or like how does that work?  </p>
<p><strong>Speaker 1    00:27:16</strong>    Sorry. I was stuck on mute. Uh, so for your first question, no, it’s not designed for other chains. Uh, at least not right now. So we’re just targeting, uh, THORChain specifically for this use case and I will have to, uh, get you some more details. The, the last I saw we were working with Jason files. So I, I’m not sure if that’s been improved upon or I definitely not storing anything on our server.  </p>
<p><strong>Speaker 6    00:27:45</strong>    Yeah. I mean, it’s not like that’s a bad thing necessarily. It’s just that you have to store when I sign, if you and I are in a multisig and I sign something and I have to put my signature somewhere so that when you sign yours, you can grab my signature. Then you broadcast the transaction to, you know, to THORChain or whatever. So it to go somewhere. I was just curious like where that storage actually was, uh, being stored.  </p>
<p><strong>Speaker 1    00:28:10</strong>    Yeah. I’ll have to get, uh, some more details about that for you, but I’ll follow up with you soon.  </p>
<h2 id="q4---have-you-guys-seen-the-new-thor-movie-yet"><a href="#q4---have-you-guys-seen-the-new-thor-movie-yet">Q4 - Have you guys seen the new Thor movie yet?</a></h2>
<p><strong>Speaker 6    00:28:16</strong>    So my, my fun question is, have you guys seen the new Thor movie yet? Th 11 thunder, like who’s seen it. Who’s not seen it.  </p>
<p><strong>Speaker 0    00:28:24</strong>    I have not seen it. <laugh>disgraceful.  </laugh></p>
<p><strong>Speaker 6    00:28:28</strong>    What? Come on Chad throw  </p>
<p><strong>Speaker 1    00:28:31</strong>    <laugh>. You haven’t seen any of em, right? Chad?  </laugh></p>
<p><strong>Speaker 0    00:28:33</strong>    Yeah. I I’m like I’m like the I’m like the least I’m like the least Thor, Thor. THORChain like, yeah. I need to, I need to understand our roots here at THORChain and really, uh, go back to the history and study, study the movies and all that. <laugh></laugh></p>
<p><strong>Speaker 1    00:28:48</strong>    I finally watched the movies when I got COVID and that was pretty fun, you know, I was like, oh, by frost, I get it now.  </p>
<p><strong>Speaker 6    00:28:57</strong>    So be fair to be the THORChain like, uh, you know, theme, not didn’t come from the movies. It came from north mythology. Right. Rather than the movies themselves, we kind of like a, a common ancestor, kinda like how we, we don’t come from chimpanzees. We have a common ancestor, but, but nonetheless I do enjoy the films and enjoy the, uh, that, that realm.  </p>
<p><strong>Speaker 0    00:29:21</strong>    Totally. Yeah. I feel like I have to, I’ve been meaning to you for a while, but it, it would be fun to just like hear the references or hear the same words and be like, oh yeah, I I’ve heard that. <laugh></laugh></p>
<p><strong>Speaker 1    00:29:31</strong>    So you liked the new one, Chad? I, I heard some people saying it was too woke, so I was nervous.  </p>
<p><strong>Speaker 6    00:29:36</strong>    Um, I mean, it was definitely not my favorite of, of all my, probably the best one in my opinion was like, uh, throw rag rock. Like that one was awesome. That one was kick ass. The second th was terrible. The first door was pretty good and the last one was like, man, kind of mediocre. Uh, but that’s just me.  </p>
<p><strong>Speaker 1    00:29:57</strong>    Well, put it on my list for sure. Is this still in theaters?  </p>
<p><strong>Speaker 6    00:30:01</strong>    Yeah, I just came out on the eighth. So it’s got probably another month or two ago.  </p>
<p><strong>Speaker 0    00:30:08</strong>    We’ll have to check it out. <laugh></laugh></p>
<p><strong>Speaker 6    00:30:10</strong>    Sorry. I had to ask, had to ask that question. Sorry. I I’ll get off the stage now.  </p>
<p><strong>Speaker 0    00:30:14</strong>    <laugh>no, you’re you’re good. Yeah, there was that guy at the, oh, after you left on last week’s main THORChain space, this dude came up just talking about the movie. It was, it was kind of hilarious. He was just like, I don’t even think he knew what THORChain or crypto even, even were. And he was just rambling out about the movie. So that was kind of funny.  </laugh></p>
<p><strong>Speaker 6    00:30:30</strong>    <laugh>well, you weren’t, if you hadn’t seen the films, you weren’t able to, you know, to converse with him here.  </laugh></p>
<p><strong>Speaker 0    00:30:37</strong>    This guy was like a comic. I don’t know. It was, it was pretty funny, but,  </p>
<p><strong>Speaker 1    00:30:41</strong>    And, and Chad, yeah, I just got confirmation from one of my developers. Uh, the signature is passed outside of the app, so we’re not storing it anywhere. It would be, you know, Hey, send this over to your other co-signers at this point.  </p>
<p><strong>Speaker 6    00:30:54</strong>    Oh, okay. Interesting. All right. Thanks for clarifying.  </p>
<p><strong>Speaker 0    00:31:01</strong>    Cool. Well you’re of course. Welcome to stay up if you want to, but uh, yeah, <laugh>, there’s always RUNE for Chad be on the panel, but feel free to jump off if you’ve got, uh, actual things to do, but, um, uh,  </laugh></p>
<p><strong>Speaker 6    00:31:12</strong>    I’ll be listening. I’ll just be listening and if you guys have something you can, but I’ll just be mostly listening.  </p>
<p><strong>Speaker 0    00:31:17</strong>    Sounds good. And we’ll be on tomorrow for the other one. So that’ll be cool. Uh, Olivia, what’s up?  </p>
<p><strong>Speaker 8    00:31:25</strong>    Hey guys. Um, can you guys hear me well?  </p>
<p><strong>Speaker 0    00:31:29</strong>    Sounds good.  </p>
<h2 id="q5---purpose-of-erc20-pools"><a href="#q5---purpose-of-erc20-pools">Q5 - Purpose of erc20 pools?</a></h2>
<p><strong>Speaker 8    00:31:31</strong>    Great. Um, so I just had a two questions. Um, first one, I think it might just be a subjective question, but with the aggregator, uh, being very close, um, would that change the purpose? Um, some of the ERC 20 pools. I know it’s not the same if they are hosted or if a pool let’s say die or SNX that don’t have the deepest liquidity, uh, live on THROchain. I know it’s not the same, but with aggregator being very close, do you guys think that, uh, in the sake of maybe capital efficiency that might redefine their purpose, uh, since they will be like die and SNX tokens will be available in one transaction?  </p>
<p><strong>Speaker 1    00:32:12</strong>    Yeah. That’s a great question. Uh, I’ve seen quite a bit of chatter about that, you know, over the last six months or so. I think that we could definitely see things evolve to a point where, you know, the ERC 20 pools disappear from THORChain over time and the E pool is all that’s left, but you know, there’s a few challenges around that. Uh, it seems like there’s at least some strong demand to keep some stable coins on the platform. I don’t know if, if Chad has any more, uh, thoughts or opinions about how that might evolve over time.  </p>
<p><strong>Speaker 6    00:32:47</strong>    Yeah. So I think we, we I’m okay with the idea of getting rid of the erc20 with the exception of the stables, because the stables are used. Um, the stable sys are used by arbitrage bots to arbitrage, and we don’t wanna take that from them in a sense. And we also use those as ways for the network to know the price of RUNE in dollars. And so that it uses that information to, for, from mostly for telemetry, but like it also use it for, um, you know, setting up a minimum, uh, Upbound fee and like, theoretically, we could use that same thing to like say that the gas price for transacting on THORChain instead of being 0.02 RUNE, which is a fluctuating price, obviously we could just set to be like 10 cents for some amount. Right. And then no matter what RUNE price is, the, the gas fee is, you know, static, which is kind of more predictable, which is also better for the community. So, uh, I’m okay with the idea of getting rid the ERC twenties, especially cause I don’t really contribute that much value anyway. Uh, but the stables I’d like to keep around, especially if we go down, if we go down the path of th we’re definitely gonna the stable around.  </p>
<p><strong>Speaker 8    00:33:51</strong>    Yeah. I think that makes sense. Um, yeah, I was just curious because if you’re, if you were going to swap, let’s say a hundred K worth of, let’s say tics, um, most likely if we aggregate with one inch, which we will do at Thorswap, um, most likely one inch, the quote from one inch will beat whatever in terms of slippage, uh, to can provide with the current liquidity. So I was just wondering for smaller trades, it will probably make sense to, to leverage, um, the pools, but for larger trades, it will probably be more worth it to, um, to the trade outside to avoid higher slippage.  </p>
<p><strong>Speaker 6    00:34:30</strong>    Yeah. That’s definitely true.  </p>
<p><strong>Speaker 0    00:34:32</strong>    Yeah. And as soon as the aggregator launches that’ll be, that’ll be live. Right. So it’ll just automatically give you the best route, uh, based on what’s available. So right. Mokey,  </p>
<p><strong>Speaker 1    00:34:43</strong>    Hey, you’ve got the man in the chat who built that Pathfinder, so he can tell you the answer to that. There  </p>
<p><strong>Speaker 8    00:34:49</strong>    We go. Yeah, yeah, no, definitely. So just, uh, hold egg on discord. So you might, uh, yeah. Um, and my second question was, um, more  </p>
<p><strong>Speaker 6    00:34:57</strong>    Specific, one more thing on that before you run in next question, just another kind of funny, interesting idea is that like, imagine a THORChain fork comes out like just called, you know, Maya protocol, for example, and then like you can do a trade where you, you can’t do a single trade because the fees would be too high in the situation that you were just talking about. But if you split the trade into two different transactions on two different protocols, Maya, and THORChain like, you split your trade into two bits and then both go through each, uh, one go through each of those networks and then get swapped to whatever it needs to get to like you’re then at that point, you’re combining the liquidity of both Mya plus THORChain together to get a better price for the user to be more efficient in, in their pricing. So that’s kinda a fascinating idea that that may happen one day.  </p>
<p><strong>Speaker 8    00:35:45</strong>    Absolutely.  </p>
<p><strong>Speaker 0    00:35:47</strong>    That’s kinda mind blowing.  </p>
<h2 id="q6---for-what-atom-is-good-or-known-currently"><a href="#q6---for-what-atom-is-good-or-known-currently">Q6 - For what ATOM is good or known currently</a></h2>
<p><strong>Speaker 8    00:35:51</strong>    Great. And yeah, my second question was, uh, more a specific, so, um, I know quite a bit about AVAX. I know quite a bit about Haven, um, and I know defi is pretty, uh, common and well, well established on AVAX. Uh, Haven obviously is a privacy focused. Uh, Ethereum kind of is a generalist with more or less privacy. Uh, I don’t know much about a, I don’t know if someone knows like what ATOM is good or known for or what is currently, uh, one of the good or well spread usage, uh, on a, I would just be curious, uh, what’s their current state and why people are on ATOM, uh, right now, what are they doing  </p>
<p><strong>Speaker 6    00:36:32</strong>    Well? So like ATOM itself, sorry to interject here, but like ATOM itself doesn’t really do a whole lot other than just like, um, voting and, and like staking and earning more ATOM on this kind of thing. Um, I think one of the reasons why people hold it is, you know, either like a dis conviction in the Cosmo ecosystem in general, uh, and just a belief that the Cowell ecosystem will, will accrue value with more chains are built and, you know, causes more value between the, the whole ecosystem. But also I think it’s possible that, that, that oftentimes when new chains come out, they do airdrops and sometimes that airdrop is based upon the a token. And so it’s a way of like, by holding ATOM, you can just get some free airdrops from time to time from various projects. And maybe some of those have become very, really valuable and maybe some of ‘em don’t, but like, I think it’s one of the reasons why people hold it.  </p>
<p><strong>Speaker 1    00:37:23</strong>    Yeah. I think from a THORChain perspective, uh, you know, we kind of see ATOM as the first step in connecting to the whole world of IBC, which, you know, is as a pretty massive ecosystem, uh, when you start talking about Osmo and everything else inside of IBC. So I, I that’s, that’s how I’ve been thinking about ATOM from a THORChain perspective is, you know, that’s our first stepping stone to be able to connect into those communities  </p>
<p><strong>Speaker 0    00:37:53</strong>    And just circling back for, since we’ve gained a lot more people, um, there’s a couple of pin tweets, the first two, um, one just explains everything we’re talking about. So if you need, if you’re, if you’re like coming from the cosmos world and you’ve never used, THORChain, Thorswap, we’ve got a bunch of guides and tutorials walking you through exactly how you can do cross chain swaps, how you can provide to liquidity pools, all that sort of thing. Um, so check that out. And there’s a second, the second pin tweet is, uh, some pretty cool cosmos THORChain, uh, merch that are, uh, that paper X, uh, designed and we’re giving away one of those, uh, on the space too. So somebody that asks a question is gonna win one of those, or you can check ‘em out on the store too, but yeah, just kind of, we were joking earlier, we get to celebrate the ATOM launch twice. So, uh  </p>
<p><strong>Speaker 9    00:38:40</strong>    <laugh></laugh></p>
<p><strong>Speaker 0    00:38:43</strong>    Um, yeah, so anyone else can feel free to request? We’ve got SM 50 up here. What’s up, man.  </p>
<p><strong>Speaker 9    00:38:51</strong>    Hi guys. Um, so I was just, uh, you guys made me think of, I was speaking with, uh, with chatting with Asian about, um, uh, we used, we talked about that a while ago and, uh, I guess that kind of got forgot, but, uh, about a, putting a timer on, uh, on somewhere later on the swap on the swap box or, uh, in the, in the, the transaction tracker, uh, for the delays based on, uh, on your swap size. Um, and I tagged, I tagged burger key, I think yesterday or today in our chat, uh, it was supposed to be something fairly simple that would’ve avoid a lot of frustration on people who don’t know why, like, why some swaps take so long to process. Like not because there is like a problem with the network, but there’s just a delay based on, on transaction size. And that’s pretty easy to be calculated, but there is actually a chart, but it’s not shown anywhere for people who waiting. Right.  </p>
<p><strong>Speaker 1    00:39:59</strong>    Yeah. Hey, uh, I did see your tag and yeah, I, I totally agree. Uh, we’ve had a, an issue open to get this feature done for, uh, a few months now, and it’s just never made it to the top of the pile so far, but I actually did talk to, uh, some of the developers again this morning about it. So we’re gonna, we’re gonna get it prioritized and we’ll get it done. Uh, a little, a little tip though, is when you do do a swap, if you look for the little to you logo in the top, right? Like in the transaction tracker, if you click on that, it will take you to the screen where it will filter by your transaction and tell you exactly how much time is left. But I know that’s not super discoverable for most people, so we’re working on it.  </p>
<p><strong>Speaker 9    00:40:43</strong>    Oh yeah. They like, I kind of get, I got feel because based on my, my use, I kind of know now how much time it takes, like on pretty much all the size now that I use. But I mean, for somebody that don’t know, like I agency, like it’s more of a, I guess, uh, a perk ad than avoid frustration for people that are not used to more than a vital critical anything.  </p>
<p><strong>Speaker 1    00:41:07</strong>    I totally agree if you send in 10 or 20 K and then you’re just seeing a spinning wheel and you’re nervous and you don’t know what’s happening, it’s really easy to panic. So I totally understand the  </p>
<p><strong>Speaker 9    00:41:19</strong>    Well, especially when the price moves a lot. Right. So you see the price move, like your price is locked in, but there, it just takes time to get to your wallet. Mm-hmm <affirmative>but like, you know, when you see prices like, oh shit, am I like getting the good price or the bad price? Is it like which one I’m getting, right.  </affirmative></p>
<p><strong>Speaker 1    00:41:35</strong>    Yeah, for sure. Now that that’s gonna be a great feature. We’ll get it out for you shortly.  </p>
<h1 id="monero-bridge"><a href="#monero-bridge">Monero bridge</a></h1>
<p><strong>Speaker 9    00:41:41</strong>    Cool. And, uh, just second part too, that was, um, for people who were talking, I, uh, I’ve, uh, tweeted that, but I don’t have that much of a reach. Uh, but I know Monero is, uh, is, uh, I guess a, a big part for a lot of enthusiasm people, but, uh, right now you can manually now aggregate your trade to get your Bitcoin to Monero since we have ATOM. Uh, so it’s more of a reminder for people that don’t know, uh, you can’t just use now, ATOM, to either go through Osmos get secret and trade it for Monero on secret, or you can straight up use your ATOM and bridge it to secret and then just convert it to Monero. So, and then you can bridge it to the native Monero. So, I mean, that’s the power of aggregation, I guess, but, uh, it’s one way, so, I mean, it’s, we don’t have the straight up pool, but it’s one way to get your, your, your, your Monero through THORChain.  </p>
<p><strong>Speaker 1    00:42:39</strong>    That that’s a cool tip. I didn’t know that. So I appreciate that.  </p>
<p><strong>Speaker 0    00:42:43</strong>    Yeah. Super interesting. So, so there’s a bridge from, from secret to Monero is what you said,  </p>
<h1 id="kill-switch-starts-in-few-days"><a href="#kill-switch-starts-in-few-days">Kill switch starts in few days</a></h1>
<p><strong>Speaker 9    00:42:48</strong>    Correct? They have, uh, ERC 20 bridge. They have, uh, about 20 bridge and they have just a bridge for Monero.  </p>
<p><strong>Speaker 0    00:42:56</strong>    Oh, nice. That’s pretty cool. Yeah, that, that’s a pretty interesting route, uh, to get there. And by the way, I’m glad you brought up the, the timer point. I think that is a huge thing, cuz yeah. When every time I’m kind of walking through somebody for the first time or somebody’s doing it on their own, then they’ll, I’ll get those DMS of people kind of worried. So yeah, I think that’s a, that’s a huge one. That’ll just give a better user experience for people that don’t already know. Haven’t done it a few times yet. So thanks for bringing that up.  </p>
<p><strong>Speaker 9    00:43:22</strong>    Yeah. I was pretty, I would’ve been useful when I was, uh, when I was, um, arbitraging back in like when we could still use binance arbitrage, uh, bep2 version. But yeah, now I use it less when this now  </p>
<p><strong>Speaker 0    00:43:38</strong>    Totally. That’s a good point. You just brought up to just a little reminder for everyone. The kill switch starts in like six, five days or so. Um, I believe on, yeah. So if anyone still is holding BEP2 or ERC 20 RUNE, uh, first off, why are you doing that? <laugh>and second off  </laugh></p>
<p><strong>Speaker 1    00:43:58</strong>    Potato get rid of this,  </p>
<p><strong>Speaker 0    00:43:59</strong>    Stop doing that. Yeah. So, um, you know, just connect your wallet to the Thorswap interface. Super simple. You’ll figure it out. If not, we have tutorials on that as well. Thorswap community YouTube, but yeah, definitely. Now’s the time or else you’re literally gonna stop. You’re gonna start getting less real RUNE in exchange for yours starting in really just a few days. So now’s the time?  </p>
<p><strong>Speaker 9    00:44:23</strong>    Well, talking of vintage were talking earlier. I have that, that now I vintage Luna sweatshirt there, but uh, yeah, I’m keeping some, uh, bep2, ERC 20 RUNEs just, uh, for the vintage part of it can say, uh, I had them since the beginning <laugh>so, or anyone just wanting to keep some, I guess it’s the time to, to get some before they disappear.  </laugh></p>
<p><strong>Speaker 0    00:44:46</strong>    <laugh>yeah. Maybe keep one, uh, just as a, as a worthless NFT <laugh>oh exactly. That’s kind of interesting.  </laugh></laugh></p>
<p><strong>Speaker 9    00:44:55</strong>    Might be they might be worth like triple things then, because there’s no liquidity. Right. You know?  </p>
<p><strong>Speaker 0    00:45:00</strong>    Yeah. Who knows? Not financial advice I would advise.  </p>
<p><strong>Speaker 9    00:45:02</strong>    Exactly. No, it’s just more for a fun.  </p>
<p><strong>Speaker 0    00:45:05</strong>    Totally. I would assume it’s worth zero. Yeah, exactly. Cause it’s worth, cause it will be worth a zero native RUNE  </p>
<p><strong>Speaker 9    00:45:12</strong>    It’s worth bragging. Right. That’s that’s worth it.  </p>
<p><strong>Speaker 0    00:45:14</strong>    <laugh></laugh></p>
<p><strong>Speaker 9    00:45:15</strong>    It’s a good one  </p>
<p><strong>Speaker 0    00:45:19</strong>    Too. Yeah.  </p>
<p><strong>Speaker 1    00:45:20</strong>    Thanks.  </p>
<p><strong>Speaker 0    00:45:22</strong>    Uh, why C  </p>
<h2 id="q7---dex-aggregator---how-do-you-handle-frontrunning-"><a href="#q7---dex-aggregator---how-do-you-handle-frontrunning-">Q7 - DEX Aggregator - how do you handle frontrunning ?</a></h2>
<p><strong>Speaker 8    00:45:23</strong>    Hi. Hi. Hi Chad. I have a question regarding the, uh, cross chain deck aggregator. How do you handle the, the front running at the target chain? Right. For example, let’s say if I set, uh, the slippage to 5%, right. Uh, but then obviously when it reaches the target chain, it cannot be 5% right. Oil. It would be front run. So how do you handle that?  </p>
<p><strong>Speaker 1    00:45:52</strong>    I’m sorry. You, you said by the time it reaches other chain, what I, I couldn’t quite understand.  </p>
<p><strong>Speaker 8    00:45:56</strong>    So for example, for example, if I want to, uh, swap from, um, BNB to, uh, SNX in I, so, uh, uh, uh, let’s say if I set the slippage of 5%, it’s not the issue at THORChain because there’s no front running on to. Right. But when you reaches the network, then it will, there will be, I mean, it cannot be 5%, right? The, the, the, the white car, uh, the, uh, the sleep page, right. It cannot be 5%. It would be susceptible to the front running. So how do you handle that?  </p>
<p><strong>Speaker 1    00:46:33</strong>    Oliver? You wanna jump in on that by chance?  </p>
<p><strong>Speaker 8    00:46:35</strong>    Yeah, absolutely. So I don’t have much time left, but so what we do right now is let’s say you want to swap in from an ERC 20. Um, it’s easier for swap in and a swap out, but let’s start with a swap in. So let’s say you’re trying to swap in from uni token into Bitcoin. Um, so what we’ll do is we’ll calculate how much uni swap you have, and then we check how much you should receive in terms of Bitcoin and set the protection limit to 5% or 3%, whatever the, the, the slippage protection you, you asked. Um, also what we do is, uh, we integrate with, uh, one inch XX, uh, uni swap V two V3 and sushi swap. And when we query what’s the exchange rate between let’s say the uni token and eat to swap into, to chain, we also get value, um, of what’s the, what’s the expected output with max maximum slippage.  </p>
<p><strong>Speaker 8    00:47:27</strong>    So in extreme, um, me condition, it might be possible that the overall trade is like a few digits of a percentage, uh, over what you asked, but it would really be an extreme condition. And it would actually be like one inch or XX or uni SW not giving us the right quote. Um, so it’s a 5% total, uh, kind a transac, uh, kinda transaction. And also we have, um, a total slippage, sorry. And also, um, we calculate what’s the expected slippage on THORChain, which is a bit more predictable or more under our control. And we kind of wanna make sure that the, the slippage from THORChain and the chain specific. So let’s say Ethereum is like the combined slippage is under your limit. And I would say from the close to now a hundred transactions that we tried, uh, none of the transaction actually went over a slippage limit. So I dunno if I answered your question correctly, but basically we account for slippage on both chains and from the providers we integrate with, uh, we ask what’s the expected outcome with maximum slippage, and we use that to set our, uh, chain slippage or protection value.  </p>
<p><strong>Speaker 8    00:48:41</strong>    Okay. No, so, but the, again is, uh, let’s say if I were to do it in two transactions, right. Chances are that I will get a better prices, right. Because I can, you know, set the sleep page at a target chain, like very low. So for example, yeah, yeah. I can set it at a very low rate. Right.  </p>
<p><strong>Speaker 1    00:49:04</strong>    I, I think one, one way you’re approaching that, correct me if I’m wrong, Oliver is that you, you’re not choosing a percentage rate when you go to the second chain, like if you’re going from, you know, Bitcoin to an ERC 20 or whatever, it might be the other way around, you’re choosing the minimum amount out and you’re calculating the slippage yourself. So it’s not, it’s not telling the, you know, one inch protocol, we allow 5% slippage. It’s saying, give me at least the minimum amount.  </p>
<p><strong>Speaker 8    00:49:31</strong>    Yes. I, I understand that. But the, but the thing is that because of the time lag, right, the, the, the slippage cannot be too low. Right. So for example, when I said the slippage, I cannot set it to 0.1% when I transferred Bitcoin to, into, to right. So most fail because of the timeline. Right. So I have to set it at a very high rate. And my concern is that if I do that, then the price execution will not be as good as if I were to, you know, do it separately.  </p>
<p><strong>Speaker 8    00:50:06</strong>    I’m trying to think. Um, I think it, it should be, it’s probably worth exploring, but, um, more maybe explained it a bit better than I did. Obviously you cannot do a crushing swap with 0.1% from an ERC 20 into, let’s say, Bitcoin, unless the liquidity is very, very high. And if you do, what’s likely to happen, is that just that the transaction’s gonna get and not go through? Um, but yeah, there are, it’s, it’s, it is possible that it’s best for small trades to do the transactions separately, but even then I think it’s kind of an edge case, and I’m not even sure that it would be beneficial for the end user. Okay. Okay. Right. And, uh, okay. Sure. Thank you. Thank you.  </p>
<p><strong>Speaker 0    00:50:58</strong>    Cool. Thanks for coming back up, Oliver. Um, anyone else want to request and come up? Uh, you’ll have a good shot at a cosmos THORChain, uh, shirt, if you do.  </p>
<p><strong>Speaker 1    00:51:09</strong>    Yeah. Where’s our cosmos atom.  </p>
<p><strong>Speaker 0    00:51:11</strong>    Yeah. Let’s get some cosmos people up here or anything can be anything Thorswap even broader. THORChain um, anything. Oh, we’ve got K coefficients. Sorry. I missed you. What’s up, man.  </p>
<h2 id="q8---what-comes-first-yield-bearing-sense-or-single-sided-lps"><a href="#q8---what-comes-first-yield-bearing-sense-or-single-sided-lps">Q8 - What comes first yield bearing sense or single-sided LPs</a></h2>
<p><strong>Speaker 11    00:51:24</strong>    What’s up fellas? Um, two questions of, is there, are there plans after, um, Dex ag and, uh, thorsafe to go with, uh, decentralized, uh, limit order books and second question, what comes first yield bearing sense or single-sided LPs. That’s all I got  </p>
<p><strong>Speaker 1    00:52:03</strong>    Those sound like Chad B questions to me.  </p>
<p><strong>Speaker 11    00:52:07</strong>    Yeah, probably, but  </p>
<p><strong>Speaker 12    00:52:08</strong>    Sorry. I was with my daughter there. What’s the question?  </p>
<p><strong>Speaker 11    00:52:12</strong>    <laugh>uh, uh, what is the, are there plans in the near future to launch decentralized limit order books and to what comes first yield bearing sense or single sided LP? Uh,  </laugh></p>
<p><strong>Speaker 12    00:52:37</strong>    Well, so, yeah, so there is some, I actually was working on that today. I was actually coding out order books today. Um, I started working on it today, at least. Um, but yeah, probably single sided yield will come out first and yield bearing things are the same thing as single sided yield. It’s just a different, different way of calling the same thing. So that’ll come out first and you kind of need that to come out first before you can do the order books. And so once that comes out, order books will come out, come out after that. And which people can do, you know, limited orders or stop loss orders or, or whatever.  </p>
<p><strong>Speaker 11    00:53:10</strong>    That’s beautiful. Thank you.  </p>
<p><strong>Speaker 0    00:53:13</strong>    That’ll be huge. Um, maybe a question for Oliver, unless you had to, I know you said you were gonna be busy, but would that be able to work with the aggregator or would that have to be isolated, like only to THORChain specific pools?  </p>
<p><strong>Speaker 8    00:53:30</strong>    I missed the first part of the questions. Can you repeat that please?  </p>
<p><strong>Speaker 0    00:53:34</strong>    Uh, just regarding like the, the potential order book feature, uh, for THORChain, if that, if there, like, would there be a way to do that with that aggregator? So with, with other pools outside of just THORChain pools or would that have to just be isolated to only THORChain pools?  </p>
<p><strong>Speaker 8    00:53:49</strong>    Um, my first and quick answer would be swap outs could probably work because, uh, everything is held mostly in the memo. Um, for, so for swap outs, let’s say you could place an order to go from Bitcoin into your favorite ERC 20 token for swap ends. Um, I’m not sure. Um, I Igar, you have an opinion on that. I, I’m not sure how feasible, uh, it is for swap ends.  </p>
<p><strong>Speaker 1    00:54:19</strong>    Yeah. I, I can’t think of a way to accomplish it off the top of my head, but you never know.  </p>
<p><strong>Speaker 0    00:54:26</strong>    Yeah. Maybe, maybe getting ahead of myself anyways, but that would be, that would be really cool. Um, cuz wow. Yeah. Then you’d have order books and every token <laugh>, that’d be wild. I mean, that’s a true decks, but it I’m pretty confident about swapout  </laugh></p>
<p><strong>Speaker 12    00:54:40</strong>    It’d be tough if you’re trying to accomplish an order book. That’s cross chain that like combining multiple order books together over different chains and different decks to, to provide a larger service like that.  </p>
<p><strong>Speaker 1    00:55:05</strong>    I think we lost Chad, but yeah, I think the answer is, I don’t know about, I don’t know about swap in, but swap out seems pretty reasonable. Wait till you, you know, see this price, but I, I’m not sure about like, you know, can you put a limit order on a, an asset that’s not on THORChain probably not. So you would almost have to build like a separate blockchain just centered around limit orders. That would, that would be pretty interesting, but I’m not sure how you would accomplish that.  </p>
<p><strong>Speaker 0    00:55:36</strong>    Got it. Well, none nonetheless, it’ll be pretty huge to have limit orders on even on just store chain. That’s still a huge thing. So that’ll be really cool. And I’m sure I’m sure Thorswap will have it, you know, as soon as it’s ready. So that’s where you’ll be able to find it. Cool. Anyone else want to request and come up? No. Oh, sorry. We got Dorian. Keep missing people. Sorry. What’s up Dorian.  </p>
<p><strong>Speaker 14    00:56:09</strong>    Um, in the, um, and this may have been already answered is, is in the current plan for, to expand the Dex aggregator for the like osmosis, um, the Osmos chain or like how’s that gonna work with with ATOM coming onboard?  </p>
<p><strong>Speaker 0    00:56:30</strong>    Yeah, definitely not. Um, day one, but that’s absolutely in the plan. So, um, there was a tweet thread. Maybe I can try to find it and pin it up, but basically was discussing, um, all of the phases to the aggregator. So there are already about five phases planned. Um, so like ERC 20 being the phase, um, I believe Solana SPL, uh, tokens might be second or, well actually no avalanche will probably come in even before that. Um, but yeah, basically the idea is to kind of go down the list and build out, build out the aggregator more and more and more over time, which really, uh, kind of like exponentially makes it more valuable each time you do another one because now you’ve connected every ERC 20 to every IBC asset or every avalanche token to every, uh, you know, ERC 20 or anything else. Right. So yeah, definitely in the plans. Um, I don’t know if, I don’t know if I would say to expect it super soon, but definitely in the plans.  </p>
<p><strong>Speaker 1    00:57:30</strong>    Yeah, definitely. In, in the plans, one of our goals, uh, if you are connected in that space and you can offer any assistance with, uh, you know, connecting us to Osmo developers, uh, APIs, one thing I’ve definitely noticed is that the ecosystem around Ethereum is a lot more mature and developer friendly as far as, you know, having all these potential partners out there with public APIs, like one inch and zero X and UNB that make it super easy from a development perspective to aggregate with them. Uh, and on the Cosmo side of things, it’s not quite so, um, far along, I would say. So if you’ve got any, uh, special knowledge or connections there definitely reach out to us at Thorswap and we would love to hear from you.  </p>
<p><strong>Speaker 0    00:58:26</strong>    Yeah. That’ll definitely be a big one, one that does come out. I, I think it’s one of the most important to, to knock out. So hopefully, hopefully we can get the resources together and make that a priority. Got C connecting what’s up C  </p>
<p><strong>Speaker 15    00:58:56</strong>    Sorry. Um, based on what, uh, Moga was just mentioning, uh, are is any of the THORChain, uh, people going to, uh, the hack ATOM event. And so end of this month, because they have, uh, really strong, uh, presence cuz one of the co-founders of OSM, uh, Joseph Lee is I based in Korea, I believe so. Um, and they’re gonna be speaking at that event. And I was wondering if with the integration of ATOM into the Thor, if the Thor, community or devs are attending those kind of, uh, collaboration events,  </p>
<p><strong>Speaker 1    00:59:44</strong>    Not me personally and not anyone that I know of, but uh, I’m not sure. I think Chad just jumped outta here. He he’s kind of a conference king, but I, I’m not sure if I’ve heard him mention that one.  </p>
<p><strong>Speaker 0    00:59:57</strong>    Yeah, same here. I haven’t heard him mention that one, so I assume not, but would be cool. Cool. Anyone else here wanna come up and ask any questions or bring up anything? Uh, if, if not we’re at the hour, but we’ll give it a last chance. See, see if it, see if we go on any other tangents <laugh>I’ll do the let let’s, uh, let’s do this giveaway. So let me make sure he’s still here. Okay. Let’s go with the cosmos THORChain shirt to, uh, Dorian for asking the, the IBC aggregator question. So, uh, shoot a DM to the Thor swap account and we’ll get you hooked up with that. So congrats.  </laugh></p>
<p><strong>Speaker 11    01:01:05</strong>    So we’re THORYield 2.0 tomorrow, right?  </p>
<p><strong>Speaker 0    01:01:08</strong>    Yeah. Yeah. That’s an exciting one. We, we were talking about that earlier, but um, yeah, launches tomorrow for both iOS and Android. Um, just really a much better th yield experience, um, makes it super easy to track all your LPs. Um, as well as Thor, staking, and even just wallet portfolio tracking, you can just add, you know, BTC E whatever, it’ll even pull ERC 20 S um, be twos and just use it as a balance tracker, uh, in addition to all your LPs and stuff like that. So, um, you could set up like multiple accounts too. So if you had like different LPs with different strategies, you could have like, you know, account one account two and kind of check ‘em, um, separately, if you wanted to things like that. Uh, what else? Oh, it’s got a really cool learn section. Um, so got all kinds of guides posted there. Um, all the videos from the Thorswap community, YouTube are, are gonna be pushed, uh, directly in the app. Um, what else? But yeah, and overall just like great redesign, like it’s much cleaner. Uh, definitely, definitely gonna be more addictive. So you’ll be checking on your positions all the time. <laugh></laugh></p>
<p><strong>Speaker 0    01:02:23</strong>    Mr. H what’s  </p>

<p><strong>Speaker 16    01:02:24</strong>    Up. Hey there. Thanks for giving me the mic. Uh, quick question. Uh, when do you guys think a Monero would be added if, if it will be added?  </p>
<p><strong>Speaker 1    01:02:36</strong>    Uh, I can only guess I can only speculate, but if I were to make a guess, I would say, uh, no sooner than six months, that would be, that would be like the super earliest mm-hmm <affirmative></affirmative></p>
<p><strong>Speaker 16    01:02:50</strong>    It would go add to hand, you know, <laugh></laugh></p>
<p><strong>Speaker 1    01:02:54</strong>    Yeah, I’m a huge fan. Uh, definitely look forward to that one. I’ve advocated for it for a long time, but you know, there’s, uh, a lot of challenges around that and it’s, it’s always just a matter of resources and there’s a, a lot of other questions around adding privacy chains as well, as far as making sure the network is sufficiently resilient and decentralized and, you know, can withstand attacks and all that fun stuff.  </p>
<p><strong>Speaker 0    01:03:21</strong>    Right. Def definitely becomes more of a target. Um, that’s also a good question for, for Chad B. Um, it comes up a lot on the weekly THORChain spaces, which by the way, is tomorrow at, uh, noon Eastern. Uh, usually it comes up like almost every week to be honest. So he, he might chat on it, but I know he’s a big fan as well. And you know, it’s a really important, it, it would make such a big splash for THORChain in many positive and also some negative ways. So it’s a really interesting one, but yeah, I think we’re all kind of rooting to see that, but sounds like some challenges to get there, but I know it’s being worked on, so  </p>
<p><strong>Speaker 1    01:04:03</strong>    Yeah, I’ve been mining Monero, uh, for a very long time.  </p>
<p><strong>Speaker 0    01:04:07</strong>    Nice.  </p>
<p><strong>Speaker 1    01:04:08</strong>    It’s cool. Cause it’s one of the only ones you can still CPU mine, you know,  </p>
<p><strong>Speaker 0    01:04:19</strong>    All righty. Let’s do. Now. This is gonna be the last call for questions. If not, we can close up,  </p>
<p><strong>Speaker 0    01:04:27</strong>    But yeah, just kind of recap for a sec. Um, check out those pin tweets. If anyone here is newer to THORChain Thor swap ecosystem, uh, check out the first thread pinned that goes over everything about the cosmos integration, everything you can do with it on Thra swap, uh, got Asian connecting here. Um, but yeah, so you can, you use your Keplr wallet, you can swap to native BTC E everything else that’s integrated into, into THORChain. Uh, if you’ve got ATOM and you’ve got RO get in that liquidity pool, it’s pretty shallow right now. So you’ll take up a good chunk of the pool perhaps <laugh>so yeah, we Def this is super recent, so good yield opportunity for, for ATOM and RUNE to jump in.  </laugh></p>
<p><strong>Speaker 1    01:05:12</strong>    Now’s your chance to be a whale.  </p>
<p><strong>Speaker 0    01:05:14</strong>    Exactly. Yeah. <laugh>what’s up Asian.  </laugh></p>
<h2 id="q10---dex-aggreagation-vs-bridge"><a href="#q10---dex-aggreagation-vs-bridge">Q10 - DEX Aggreagation vs bridge</a></h2>
<p><strong>Speaker 17    01:05:21</strong>    Um, yeah, I had a quick question about the Dex aggregation. I understand that the first, uh, Dex aggregation for Thorswap is gonna be, you know, those four aggregators that Mo mentioned, um, directly with, you know, those, those four, um, Dexus um, I understand that like Rango defi spot and some of the other, you know, Dexus are also creating aggregators. My question is, um, is there just like the difference between that and just using like a bridge, just trusting the bridge when you are making like that swap through the aggregator? Cause to my understanding that’s, that would really be the only difference.  </p>
<p><strong>Speaker 1    01:06:01</strong>    Uh, I, I think that really the key differentiator is, is that you have only a single transaction. So if you’re using a bridge, you’re always gonna have to use multiple transactions to get where you’re going. Right. Some people try to make that easier, like Rango does, you know, and they’ll say, okay, here’s your first transaction, wait, three minutes, wait, five minutes. Now your next one pops up, whatever. But, uh, the aggregator is able to wrap those contracts on both sides and just do it in a single transaction. I think, I think that’s really the biggest difference and, you know, trust in a bridge. If you’re only doing it for a moment, usually you don’t have to worry, you know, a lot of times you might want to just go check, is everything okay with this bridge? Is it working? Has it been, uh, paying out like it’s supposed to?  </p>
<p><strong>Speaker 1    01:06:48</strong>    I think we saw a lot of that. Like when, when Terra fell apart, like, oh shoot, I sent a bunch of money into this bridge and it hasn’t paid anything out in 12 hours. Uh, so, you know, you’re not gonna have to trust anyone as far as goes there’s, there’s not any custody of your funds happening. Um, you know, you’ll go through a, a THORChain liquidity pool if you’re doing a, a swap for a moment, but you know, those are decentralized TSS secure and not generally, uh, held in a bridge multisig, like, like most of the bridges are.  </p>
<p><strong>Speaker 17    01:07:19</strong>    Great. Awesome. Thanks.  </p>
<p><strong>Speaker 0    01:07:26</strong>    Sweet. Well, I think we can wrap up, but, um, yeah. Great to see the ATOM integration finally live, uh, new THORYield tomorrow. Definitely keep an eye out for that and get it downloaded and, and poke around. Um, thorsafe coming soon. Go ahead.  </p>
<p><strong>Speaker 1    01:07:43</strong>    Special. Thanks to Oliver for jumping up here and, uh, sharing his expertise with the, uh, API aggregator stuff.  </p>
<p><strong>Speaker 0    01:07:50</strong>    Absolutely. Yeah. Shout out to him. That was, that was a great, uh, surprise. Chad B as well. Um, got some he’s  </p>
<p><strong>Speaker 1    01:07:56</strong>    A regular  </p>
<p><strong>Speaker 0    01:07:57</strong>    <laugh>true. Yeah. True. Got some superstars you as well. Yeah, always, always thank you to you for, for, um, you know, shining a light on all the technical stuff that I have no idea what I’m talking about. <laugh>I get excited about the stuff, but you can kind of explain what’s what’s really going on. So we, uh, I think we make maybe 10% more <laugh>I think we make a pretty good, uh, duo on these, but yeah. Thanks everyone for, for tuning in. Um, we do these ones every other Thursday typically, but yeah, every two weeks and check out the, the, the THORChain weekly is gonna be tomorrow morning as well. So if you, if you need another hit of, uh, some, some THORChain, uh, tomorrow then yeah. That’ll you can check that out too. Sweet. Thanks everybody. See you. </laugh></laugh></laugh></p>
